# ✅ API Scaffolding & Shared DB Helper — Feature Summary

This document summarises the scope and completion of two core API foundation features for the Street Support Network rebuild.

---

## 1️⃣ `feature/scaffold-api-route-structure`

**Purpose:**  
Establish a clean, standardised file and folder structure for all serverless API endpoints in the new Next.js App Router.

**Key points:**  
- All public Read API routes live under `/src/app/api/`.
- Consistent naming: `/locations`, `/categories`, `/client-groups`, `/service-providers`, `/services`, `/faqs`, and dynamic `[slug]` route for individual service provider details.
- Route handlers use TypeScript and share common patterns for filters, pagination, and query shape.
- Routes are documented and mapped to feature tickets for traceability.

**Status:** ✅ **Done** — API folder structure is standardised and routes are scaffolded following the agreed plan.

## 2️⃣ `feature/define-shared-db-helper`

**Purpose:**  
Create a robust, reusable MongoDB connection helper to avoid duplicate connections and prevent build-time environment errors in Next.js 15 App Router.

**Key points:**  
- Replaces the static `clientPromise` pattern with a safe `getClientPromise()` function.
- Ensures the database connection is **lazy** — runs only at runtime, not during static build or route file import.
- Uses global caching in development to avoid multiple connects on hot reload.
- Exported as a function, called inside each route (`await getClientPromise()`).
- Routes updated to import and use the helper correctly.

**Status:** ✅ **Done** — The shared DB helper is production-safe and used consistently in all API handlers.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Maintain this structure for all new endpoints.
- Any new database calls must use `getClientPromise()` to ensure safe runtime behaviour.
