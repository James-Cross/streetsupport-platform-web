## 🔁 Test Strategy

- Test-driven development (TDD) applied where possible
- Components are tested in isolation
- API routes will be tested using integration suites where applicable

### ✅ Find Help – End-to-End (Playwright)

**Coverage:**
- Page loads and fallback UI appears if geolocation is blocked
- Manual postcode entry sets location
- Category and subcategory filters function correctly
- Map toggle button reveals map interface
- Services display correctly based on geolocation and filters

**File:** `e2e/find-help.spec.ts`  
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing  
**Date:** 2025-06-03  
**Notes:** Mocks used for category API; geolocation stubbed for result validation
**Notes:** Mocks used for category API; geolocation stubbed for result validation

**Coverage:**
- Map renders on page load
- Location markers become visible

**File:** `e2e/homepage.spec.ts`
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing
**Date:** 2025-06-09
**Notes:** Uses mocked map pins for reliability

### ✅ Organisation Entry – End-to-End (Playwright)

**Coverage:**
- Organisation details load correctly

## 🚀 Recent Major Fixes (2025-07-18)

### E2E Test Stabilization
- **Issue:** Organisation page meta tags test failing in CI due to empty page titles
- **Root Cause:** Missing `generateMetadata` function and 404 pages without proper titles
- **Solution:** 
  - Added `generateMetadata` function to organisation page with fallback handling
  - Created global `not-found.tsx` page with proper metadata
  - Added environment variable checks to skip API calls when database unavailable

### TypeScript & Linting Cleanup
- **Issue:** Multiple TypeScript compilation errors in CI builds
- **Fixed:**
  - Removed invalid `strictSelectors` property from Playwright config
  - Fixed `MONGODB_URI` environment variable typing
  - Added proper Address interface with MongoDB structure
  - Fixed type casting in `categoryLookup.ts`
  - Added proper error handling in global-setup.ts

### Build & CI Status
- **Before:** E2E tests failing in CI, TypeScript compilation errors
- **After:** All 51 E2E tests passing, clean build with no errors
- **Impact:** CI pipeline now fully green, deployments can proceed safely

### Feature Completion
- **Search Navigation State Preservation:** ✅ Merged to main repository
- **Branch Management:** ✅ Cleaned up all development branches
- **Production Readiness:** ✅ All critical systems operational
