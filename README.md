# Street Support Platform Web

This is the public-facing platform for the Street Support Network. It helps people find local services, share information, and collaborate across the homelessness sector.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15**
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Jest + React Testing Library**
- **Playwright** for end-to-end tests
- **PowerShell scripts** (for Windows development)
- **JSON-based mock data** (local only; to be replaced by full CMS/API integration)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Unit and integration tests use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

Run all unit tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

Run end-to-end tests with Playwright:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Testing Highlights:**
- Babel is configured via `babel.config.json`
- Module aliases (`@/components/...`) use `moduleNameMapper` in `jest.config.cjs`
- Geolocation and other browser APIs are stubbed or guarded
- Mocks live under `tests/__mocks__/`

✅ **All tests must pass before merging into `staging` or `main`.**

## 🧱 Admin CMS

The admin CMS is a separate repo:  
➡️ [streetsupport-platform-admin](https://github.com/streetsupport/streetsupport-platform-admin)

It manages all partner organisation data and connects to this public platform via API.

---

## 📂 Local Development

Run the project locally with mock JSON data:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Key local data sources:
- `src/data/service-providers.json` — mock service provider data
- `src/data/locations.json` — fetched location metadata
- `src/data/service-categories.json` — fetched category and subcategory metadata
- `src/data/client-groups.json` — fetched client group metadata

---

## 🧭 Project Structure

- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router structure (pages, dynamic routes, API endpoints)
- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components and layout partials
- `src/contexts/` — React context providers (e.g. `LocationContext`, `FilterContext`)
- `src/content/` — Location-specific or static page content (e.g. prebuilt templates)
- `src/data/` — JSON data for mock services, locations, and categories
- `src/types/` — Shared TypeScript types
- `src/utils/` — Utility functions (e.g. DB helpers, formatters)
- `tests/__tests__/` — Unit tests for components, utils, and contexts
- `tests/e2e/` — End-to-end tests (Playwright specs)
- `tests/__mocks__/` — Mocks for third-party modules and stubs
- `config/` — Config files (Jest, ESLint, Playwright)
- `public/` — Static assets (images, icons)
- `scripts/` — Custom build or data fetch scripts

---

## 🌍 Location Pages — Our Approach

- Each **location page** (e.g. `/manchester`) is powered by a single **dynamic App Router route** using `[slug]/page.tsx`.
- The pages share a common template and pull their data from `locations.json` or future API calls.
- Local banners, news and map pins will come from the CMS or the public API.
- We use `generateStaticParams` for static builds where possible, with a `force-dynamic` fallback for maximum reliability.

## 🔄 Git Workflow

✅ See the **[WORKFLOW.md](./docs/WORKFLOW.md)** for full details.

In short:
1. Create a new feature branch from `staging`
2. Work and commit in that branch
3. PR into `streetsupport/streetsupport-platform-web` `staging`
4. Merge once tests pass
5. Open a PR from `staging` → `main`
6. Sync your fork’s `staging` with upstream

We acknowledge the npm audit warnings for `esbuild`, `path-to-regexp`, and `undici`.  
These affect dev only, not production security.
